According to the results shown in previous section, we must conclude C\# partial classes are not a suitable mechanism to achieve feature-oriented programming. The main problems come from:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Lack of support for feature modules and feature encapsulation.
    \item Lack of support for extending existing methods.
    \item Lack of support for overriding existing methods.
    \item Lack of support for composition at the feature level.
\end{enumerate}
