				    <p>The goal of a software product line (Pohl et al, 2005) is to create an adequate  infrastructure from which you could construct, as automatically as possible, specific  products within a software products family. A software products family is a  set of similar software applications, which therefore share some common  characteristics, but also have variations between them.</p>
				    <p>The software to control a smart home is an example of a domain where  product line approach is really adequate. This software provides a wide range  of variations due to to different devices can be controlled in each home type (eg.:  windows, doors, lights, heaters) and the functions that you want those devices  comply (eg.: presence simulation, automatic on/off lights, smart energy control)</p>
				    <p>The aim of the project is a software product line for smart homes, so  that you can automate the process of developing specific applications for  specific homes. This infrastructure is developed  on the platform .NET, using Visual Studio 2010. Partial classes of C# are used as  the main mechanism for modularization, composition and management of the different  variable characteristics that compound the software product line. The description or informal  specification of requirements to be met by the product line is based on an  industrial case study provided by Siemens AG.</p>
				    <p>Thus, we have developed two plugins for development environment Visual  Studio 2010, which the users could model smart homes, selecting the features  that best fit their requirements. And through these models, the users could derivate  automatically specific applications for each model. </p>
